-- Winter 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge

--Question 1: 
a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
The naively calculated average order value (AOV) is the mean of all 5000 transactions' order amount across the 100 sneakers shops over a 30 day window. By definition, $3145.13 is not the average order value.

For each sneaker store, the AOV is equal to the order amount divided by the number of transactions. Using R, I summed the order amount for each store and counted the number of transactions for each store over a 30 day window. Then,
I calculated the AOV for each store.

There are two outliers, which are shop 42 with an AOV of $235,101.49 and shop 78 with an AOV of $49,213.04. 
 -Shop 42 placed in total 51 transactions, where 17 transactions have a single transaction order amount of $704,000 for 2,000 items.
 -Shop 78 placed in total 46 transactions, where each item costs $25,725.

By excluding shop 42 and 78, the average order value of the 98 stores is $299.68. 

b. What metric could you report for this dataset?
Since there are two outliers, shop 42 and shop 78, I would report median AOE for the dataset as mean can be skewed can be greatly skewed by these two outliers.

c. What is its value?
The median AOE for the dataset is $308.89.

--Question 2: 
a. How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
Using the query below, the total number of orders shipped by Speedy Express is 54

SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(OrderID) as NumberofOrders FROM Orders
JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
WHERE Shippers.ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';

b. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
Using the query below, the last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock, who placed 40 orders.

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(OrderID) as NumberofOrders
FROM orders 
JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.LastName
ORDER BY NumberofOrders DESC;

c. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
Using the query below, Boston Crab was ordered the most by customers in Germany. Total quantities are 160. 

SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity) AS TotalQuantityOrdered
FROM Orders 
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
WHERE Customers.Country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY Products.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalQuantityOrdered DESC;
